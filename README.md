## arch-i3

This is my ongoing project to use Arch Linux with i3 Windows Manager on the Samsung Chromebook Plus.

The Chromebook Plus is a touchscreen chromebook with an App Store running on ARM, so somethings that are x86 will not be compatible.


Other things to keep in mind
- Setup local timezone
- Test with usb devices
- Download Chrome (chromium)
- Possibly change mod key to Search/Capslock thingy

# Todo

Big Problems:
1. Audio through headphones (issues with identifying jack)
2. Auto-connect Wifi
3. Fix boot time (think this has something to do with wifi hanging)

Nice things to have:
1. Multiple finger gestures
2. Backup configs on github -DONE
