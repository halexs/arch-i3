# arch-i3

This is my ongoing project to use Arch Linux with i3 Windows Manager on the Samsung Chromebook Plus.

The Chromebook Plus is a touchscreen chromebook with an App Store running on ARM, so somethings that are x86 will not be compatible.

#Todo

Big Problems:
Audio through headphones
Auto-connect Wifi
Fix boot time

Nice things to have:
multiple finger gestures
backup configs on github
